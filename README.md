# GPT Mini Clone

Welcome to the GPT Mini Clone repository! ü§ñ‚ú® This project is a simplified implementation of a GPT-like model, designed to provide an accessible and lightweight version of large language models. Ideal for experimentation, learning, and development, GPT Mini Clone offers a starting point for those interested in understanding and working with generative language models.

## üìú Overview

GPT Mini Clone brings the core functionalities of GPT models into a more manageable size, making it easier to run and experiment with generative language tasks. This project focuses on maintaining the essential features while offering a more efficient and easier-to-use model.

## üöÄ Features

- **Lightweight Model:** A compact version of GPT that is easier to train and deploy.
- **Generative Capabilities:** Generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on input prompts.
- **Customizable Architectures:** Modify the model architecture to fit specific needs or constraints.
- **Pretrained Weights:** Utilize pretrained weights for quick setup and testing.
- **Simplified Training:** Streamlined training process with straightforward configuration options.
